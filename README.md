# Computer Architecture in C

A Collection of Code from CDA-4102: Computer Architecture.

A major topic in this course is: [Unix Processes in C](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfqABt5AS4FkW5mOn2Tn9ZZLLDwA3kZUY), so there is a YouTube tutorial playlist.

The book following this course is [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 3/E](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/)
 - This book uses programming in C language for assignments.

Another good book for Computer Architecture is: [Structured Computer Organization](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/structured-computer-organization/P200000003183/9780137618446)
 - This book is more about hardware and does not include programming.

 - Remember that `scanf()` is vulnerable to buffer overflow, to use `fgets()` instead, as discussed in the article.
